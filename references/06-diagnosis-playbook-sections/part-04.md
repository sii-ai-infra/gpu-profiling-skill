## Pattern I — Synchronization overhead

**Signals:**
- `smsp__pcsamp_warps_issue_stalled_barrier` > 20% of samples.
- Source hotspot line is `BAR.SYNC`.

**Why:** `__syncthreads()` waits for the slowest warp. Combined with any per-warp work imbalance, this amplifies.

**First-line fix:**
- Replace block-level syncs with warp-level primitives (`__shfl_sync`, `__ballot_sync`, `__syncwarp`) where only warp-scoped synchronization is needed.
- Reduce total sync count — consolidate multiple synchronized phases.

**Deeper fixes:**
- Warp-specialized execution: producer warps and consumer warps with mbarrier instead of `__syncthreads`.

**Cross-ref:** `cuda-optimization` principle 16 (`references/fix-directions.md` for the fix menu, `references/legitimate-violations.md` for the kernel types where this reading is correct); `references/blackwell-shifts.md` for how B200 changes its weight.

## Pattern J — Low achieved vs theoretical occupancy

**Signals:**
- `sm__maximum_warps_per_active_cycle_pct > 50` but `sm__warps_active.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_active << 50`.
- NCU rule: *"The difference between calculated theoretical (X%) and measured achieved occupancy (Y%) ..."*.

**Why:** Theoretical occupancy is the max warps that *could* be resident. Achieved is how many are *actually* running. Gap is caused by: stalls (leaves slots empty), imbalance (some SMs empty), short kernel (warmup dominates).

**Reading:** if the gap is large AND Pattern B (tail effect) is present, fixing imbalance will close the gap. If no imbalance, look at stall reasons (Pattern E, H, I).

**First-line fix:** look for the stall reason causing the gap and address that pattern.

## Pattern K — Register spill

**Signals:**
- `smsp__sass_inst_executed_op_local_ld.sum > 0` or `smsp__sass_inst_executed_op_local_st.sum > 0`.
- NCU rule: *"N bytes spilled to local memory"* in Instruction Statistics.
- `launch__registers_per_thread > 128`.

**Why:** compiler couldn't fit all live variables in registers, spilled some to local memory (which is DRAM-backed).

**First-line fix:** `__launch_bounds__(maxThreadsPerBlock, minBlocksPerMultiprocessor)` on the kernel. This tells the compiler to stay within a register budget.

**Deeper fixes:**
- Reduce the number of live values: recompute values instead of caching, split the kernel into two.
- Move per-thread arrays to shared memory with explicit indexing.

**Exceptions:**
- Large fused kernels (FlashAttention) accept some spill in exchange for larger savings upstream.

**Cross-ref:** `cuda-optimization` principle 6 (`references/fix-directions.md` for the fix menu, `references/legitimate-violations.md` for the kernel types where this reading is correct); `references/blackwell-shifts.md` for how B200 changes its weight.

## Pattern L — FP64 used unintentionally

**Signals:**
- `sm__pipe_fp64_cycles_active.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_active > 0` in a kernel that "should" be FP32.

**Why:** C/C++ floating-point literals (`1.0`, `0.5`, `3.14`) default to `double`. A `float x = a + 1.0 * b;` promotes `a + 1.0*b` to double.

**First-line fix:** add `f` suffix to all literals: `1.0f`, `0.5f`, `3.14f`. Add `__expf` / `__logf` / `__sinf` variants for transcendentals.

**Cross-ref:** `cuda-optimization` principle 8 (`references/fix-directions.md` for the fix menu, `references/legitimate-violations.md` for the kernel types where this reading is correct); `references/blackwell-shifts.md` for how B200 changes its weight.

## Pattern M — Pipeline bubbles (no compute/memory overlap)

**Signals:**
- PM timeline of `sm__throughput` and `dram__throughput` shows a sawtooth (high compute ↔ high DRAM alternating).
- `long_scoreboard` stalls high but DRAM throughput also high.

**Why:** kernel loads a tile, computes on it, loads next tile — single-buffered.

**First-line fix:** double-buffer. Use two shared-memory tiles; while computing on tile A, load tile B. `__syncthreads` between phases.

**Deeper fixes:**
- Multi-stage pipeline (3-4 stages on Blackwell — see KernelWiki `wiki/nvidia/techniques/pipeline-stages.md` for stage-count selection). Use `cp.async` / TMA for async loads.

**Cross-ref:** `cuda-optimization` principle 15 (`references/fix-directions.md` for the fix menu, `references/legitimate-violations.md` for the kernel types where this reading is correct); `references/blackwell-shifts.md` for how B200 changes its weight.

## Pattern N — Warp divergence

**Signals:**
- `smsp__thread_inst_executed_per_inst_executed.ratio < 32` (far from the 32 ideal).
- Branch efficiency metric low in `--page details`.
- Divergent branches cluster on specific source lines.

**Why:** lanes in a warp take different paths at a branch; hardware serializes.

**First-line fix:**
- Rearrange so all lanes in a warp take the same branch. Sort / partition data if possible.
- Convert `if (cond) a else b` to branchless `mask * a + (1-mask) * b` — cheap if both sides are cheap.

**Exceptions:**
- Tree reductions in warps (last few steps have half / quarter / ... active). Use `__shfl_down_sync` to handle cleanly.
- Boundary handling (a few warps at tensor edge) — not worth fighting.

**Cross-ref:** `cuda-optimization` principle 5 (`references/fix-directions.md` for the fix menu, `references/legitimate-violations.md` for the kernel types where this reading is correct); `references/blackwell-shifts.md` for how B200 changes its weight.
