# Skill: CUDA Kernel Profiling (B200 / H200 / Nsight Compute)

运行前按 [目录与依赖约定](references/index.md) 确认 SKILL_ROOT、TASK_ROOT、KOP_ROOT 和 KERNELWIKI_ROOT。


**When to use:** user asks to profile a CUDA kernel, analyze its performance, find its bottlenecks, or write an optimization plan based on Nsight Compute data. Triggers include: "profile X", "为什么这个 kernel 慢", "ncu report 说...", "下一步怎么优化", "帮我看一下这份 ncu 报告".

**Target hardware (this repo):** NVIDIA B200 (sm_100) and NVIDIA H200 (sm90); read the target device properties for capacities and SM counts. Most advice below is generic; B200-specific notes are explicitly marked.

## Golden rule

**Profile → Diagnose → Plan, in that order. Never guess.**

Use the report to form and compare bottleneck hypotheses. A kernel can have several interacting limits; one metric rarely establishes the cause. Rank proposed changes by evidence and expected impact under the task objective.

## Quickstart (what to do when someone says "profile this kernel")

0. **Create a new run directory first** under `profile/<run_name>/` under TASK_ROOT — **one directory per run**, never reuse an existing one. Each run contains its own `harness/`, `reports/`, `analysis/`, and `REPORT.md`. This rule is mandatory in the task workspace. See [`references/index.md`](references/index.md).

1. **Decide what you're profiling.** What inputs? Which dispatch path? What question do you want answered? If the kernel takes variable-sized inputs (variable seq lengths, variable batch sizes), you must pick specific representative shapes from the user's workload — don't profile with arbitrary inputs.

2. **Build a standalone harness** unless the user is profiling through their existing binary. Harnesses compile in seconds, run the kernel in isolation, and let you use `-lineinfo` cleanly so ncu can map SASS back to source. Compile into `profile/<run_name>/harness/`. See [`references/index.md`](references/index.md) and the template in [`scripts/harness_template.cu`](scripts/harness_template.cu).

3. **For a new capture, choose the reports needed to answer the question**: `--set full` (with `PmSampling` sections) for the overview, and `--set source --section SourceCounters` for per-line stall attribution. Write outputs to `profile/<run_name>/reports/`. See [`references/index.md`](references/index.md).

4. **Parse with `ncu_report`** Python module — not by eye-balling the CLI. Write analysis outputs to `profile/<run_name>/analysis/`. Use the helpers in [`scripts/`](scripts/). See [`references/index.md`](references/index.md).

5. **Work through the six analysis dimensions.** See [`references/index.md`](references/index.md). Every one matters, but on any given kernel only 1–2 will dominate.

6. **Match patterns to the diagnosis playbook.** See [`references/index.md`](references/index.md). It maps NCU signal → likely cause → concrete fix, with example counts for "how big is this".

7. **Write the report** at `profile/<run_name>/REPORT.md` with evidence-backed recommendations, ranked by expected impact. See [`references/index.md`](references/index.md).

## File index

### Reference navigation

Use the [reference index](references/index.md) to choose the relevant workflow, collection, analysis, diagnosis or reporting page. The index also links runtime configuration and topic subdirectories.

### Helpers (reusable code)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`scripts/harness_template.cu`](scripts/harness_template.cu) | Standalone harness template — paste your kernel, fill in input allocation, done |
| [`scripts/instrumentation_snippet.cu`](scripts/instrumentation_snippet.cu) | Copy-paste `clock64()` / `%globaltimer` probes for per-CTA phase timing |
| [`scripts/safetensors_loader.h`](scripts/safetensors_loader.h) | Header-only safetensors reader (no external deps) for loading real workload tensors |
| [`scripts/analyze_reports.py`](scripts/analyze_reports.py) | Extract key metrics, produce side-by-side comparisons |
| [`scripts/extract_stall_hotspots.py`](scripts/extract_stall_hotspots.py) | Per-line stall aggregation via `action.source_info(pc)` |
| [`scripts/plot_timeline.py`](scripts/plot_timeline.py) | ASCII PM-sampling timeline plotter — makes tail effect visible |
| [`scripts/list_flashinfer_workloads.py`](scripts/list_flashinfer_workloads.py) | Browse a flashinfer-trace dataset — shape histograms, filter by axis, resolve safetensors paths for specific UUIDs |
| [`scripts/ncu_utils.py`](scripts/ncu_utils.py) | Shared Python helpers: safe metric access, per-instance extraction, report loading |

## Critical lessons (don't skip)

1. **The stock `ncu_profile_skill.md` metric names don't all work on B200.** Names like `smsp__inst_executed_op_global_ld.sum`, `dram__bytes.sum`, `l1tex__average_t_sectors_per_request*.ratio` return `None` on sm_100. Use the sm_100 names in [`references/index.md`](references/index.md) or enumerate via `action.metric_names()`.

2. **Always compile with `-lineinfo`.** Without it, ncu's source view is blank and you cannot do per-line stall analysis. If you can't add `-lineinfo` to the build system (TVM-FFI, PyTorch inline, JIT), **build a standalone harness** — that's the whole point.

3. **Use time-resolved evidence for tail effects.** PM sampling can show utilization over time; per-CTA timing can also test imbalance. Whole-kernel averages alone do not show when utilization falls.

4. **Load-imbalance on variable-length inputs is often the #1 bottleneck.** If the user's workload has sequences of varying length, per-SM active-cycle variance will often dwarf every other effect. Always check the input distribution.

5. **Kernel-internal instrumentation is a probe, not a replacement for NCU.** Use `clock64()` / `%globaltimer` probes when you need per-CTA or per-phase timing, but validate the hypothesis with an uninstrumented NCU run. See [`references/index.md`](references/index.md).

6. **NCU's rule engine (`--page details`) already does half the work.** Each rule comes with `Est. Speedup: X%`. Read them first — they often point straight at the answer.

7. **Don't delegate understanding.** Run the profiles yourself, open the reports, cite specific metric values. Never write "the profile shows it's memory-bound" — instead, name the two or three metric values that back your conclusion (e.g., "`dram__bytes_read.sum.pct_of_peak_sustained_elapsed` well under 10%, and `long_scoreboard` stalls dominate the pcsamp histogram, so DRAM bandwidth saturation is not established; inspect cache hit rates, dependency chains and outstanding requests to locate the latency bottleneck"). Fill in the actual numbers from your report. Specificity is the deliverable.

## Related skills

- **`cuda-optimization`** (repo `cuda-skill`) — the judgement layer for CUDA C++ kernels: the sixteen general principles as a routing table, the fix directions each one offers, which kernel types *legitimately* violate which principle, and which principles shift weight on Blackwell. Use it when proposing *new* kernel designs or when deciding whether a warning this skill surfaced is a real problem; use **this** skill when diagnosing an *existing* kernel from a report.
- **`KernelWiki`** — measurements, thresholds and metric semantics. Anything of the form "what is the ideal value of X" is a fact and lives there, not here.
